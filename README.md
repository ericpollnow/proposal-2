# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
The new and improve Roulette 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My goal for this project is to code the game roulette. I would like to create my own version of roulette.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

As i mentioned I would like to create my own version of roulette. I will be probaly use visual studio code. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

During this project I hope to at least get just the basic game of roulette done.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to obviously get the basic game of roulette done, and also add some pictures and other features to the game.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible outcome is to make the greatest game of roulette of all time. Also I would like it to run nice and smooth and be able for anyone to access it easily.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For the most part I already have an idea of how to code the simplest form of roulette but if I want to add other features like pictures I need to do more research on that part.
